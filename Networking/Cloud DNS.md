# Cloud DNS

Cloud DNS is a fully managed service provided by Google. It is a high performance, resilient, global domain name system service that publishes your domain names to the global DNS in a cost-effective way.
They promise to provide a reliable, low-latency lookup for your domain from anywhere in the world.

- Hierarchical distributed database that lets you store IP addresses and other data and look them up by name. - Publish zones and records into the DNS without having to manage your own server.
- No burden of managing your own server.
- Every Cloud DNS instance lives within a project.


## Managed Zone

A managed zone is an entity that manages DNS records for a given suffix (example.com). It is maintained by the cloud DNS. Exactly the same as a normal zone.

## Record Types

Just like a regular DNS server there are several record types:
- A - Address record, maps hostnames to IPv4 addresses.
- SOA - Start of authority - specifies authoritative information on a managed zone. This record is created when you create your managed zone for a particular suffix.
- MX - Mail exchange is used to route requests to mail servers.
- NS - Name Server record, delegates a DNS zone to an authoritative server.

## Resource Record Changes

Cloud DNS holds a resource records sets collection. This collection holds the current state of the DNS records that  make up a particular managed zone. You can read this collection but you donâ€™t modify it directly. In order to modify a record in the record collection, you raise a change request containing additions or deletions can be done in bulk or a single atomic transaction. These changes are first picked up by the authorities servers and then the DNS resolvers when their cache expires.
