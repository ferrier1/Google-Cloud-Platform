# Cloud SQL

- Hosted MySQL or PostgreSQL database
- Direct *lift and shift* of either of the above databases
    - Minimal modification required
    - Exact same use case and interaction as with on-premise implementations of these RDBMS
- Traditional relational database (SQL)
- Often a first step in a cloud migration
- Managed, but still need to provision individual machines
    - Managed single Compute Engine VM
    - Many similarities to configuring a GCE instance
- What components are managed?
    - OS/database install and updates
    - Storage capacity can autoscale for the VM
        - Able to set limit
    - Backups
    - Failover
    - Read replicas
- Limitations
    - Cap of 10TB of storage for a single Cloud SQL instance
        - If on-prem MySQL database in greater than 10TB, you will either need to shard it into multiple instances or use another managed database offering
    - Limited in horizontal scalability
        - Can add more compute to a single instance
        - Cant increase number of instances (read replicas only)
