# Machine Learning Services

Machine learning is the process of teaching computer algorithms to understand data without having to explicity program it

  - Image recognition (google photos), predictive analysis
  - One of the fastest growing fields and rapidly expanding GCP services
  - Multiple services:
    - Managed model training (Cloud ML Engine)
    - Pre-trained models

### What problem does it solve?
  - Depends on service:
    - **Cloud ML Engine:** - Provide managed resources for training own custom ML model - If you have something specific that the pre-trained models cant fill
    - **Pre-trained API's:** - Google-trained ML models to *plug-in* to your own application
      - Image and Voice recognition, etc...
    - New solutions in rapid development (BigQuery ML)
